# Building a Trump Tweet Classifier with Keras
A small project written in Python that uses a Neural Network to predict
 when a tweet was written by Donald Trump, and when it was written by his staff.

The project uses [Keras](https://keras.io) for model building and is a nice simple introduction to building, evaluating,
and using Neural Networks for binary classification of text.

Data for the project can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive).
